/* This class is for styles specific to this Button component variant,
   supplementing the global .btn and .btn-primary classes. */
.custom-button-styling {
  width: 250px; /* Default width for this reusable button variant */
  height: 45px; /* Default height for this reusable button variant */
  /* Add any other styles that are truly unique to this .custom-button-styling variant
     and not covered by .btn or .btn-primary.
     For example, if it had a specific margin not suitable for a utility class,
     or a unique hover/focus effect not part of btn-primary.
     The global .btn class provides base padding, so the fixed width/height here
     will override that if the box-sizing allows. Consider if padding or fixed size is desired.
     If padding is preferred for flexibility, remove width/height and let content + .btn padding define size.
     If fixed size is a strict requirement for this component, these are fine.
